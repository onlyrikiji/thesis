The university has two modes of learning— online and correspondence. While there is progress with the first one, the latter is stagnant. No invalidation intended for those students under the online mode of learning, they have their own struggles, as we have. We understand the difficulty of our current situation for the admin as well. However, are we to continue understanding to the extent that it invalidates and romanticize our struggles? We are called ""Iskolar ng Bayan"" for a reason— to demand a good quality of education. However, if our shouts are not heard, will we just be left out and forgotten? We've been trying to reach out for a while now, yet actions are ",Negative,1

 It's been a while since I had a crush on you. It even made me up all night thinking about things we could be. 
 But I don't know if you will like me... or see ""the me"" within me. My affection and attraction for you grows as time goes by, 
 and it kills me to bear all of it without you knowing. I was actually planning to confess to you last 31st of December 11:58pm, letting my thoughts and feelings free as the firecrackers outside our windows explodes. But... I did not, 'coz you left my semi-sweet Christmas greeting freezing. And from that, it made me think, what more if I send my confession will it just be left unread or unnoticed? I am not insinuating nor expecting for you to reciprocate my feelings but yep, that's how things goes nowadays. Anyhow, I really hope that you're doing fine, and good luck on your future endeavors in life. I just want you to know that there's someone cherishing you from afar. Thank you for keeping me on my toes and reminding me that it is always okay to ""hinto, upo, hinga, tayo"" and continue the fight. ",Neutral,1

 Its been month since nagbreak sila pero I have no Idea until she brought it up. We chatted a few and all and jokingly I told her I'll come and visit to bring something (since me being the good friend and all).
 She agreed and will treat me daw in a fastfood. so on and so forth, I headed there and we ate and talked a few, tapos gumala muna kami almost anywhere, It was joyful and fun, but I do had to get home soon. Kaya we bid our goodbyes muna and thanks. Since then, I began to think more and more about her, we would always hit up in chats, and minsan nagkakaayaan parin palagi kung saan-saan more than my girl, but I must not kasi nga I am currently in a relationship with someone else. Yes we have to know our limits and all, and I always tell my gf where I go and who I go with.
 Its just really really hard to bare the situation, I know its my fault for doing so pero hopefully I'll change my mind and feelings soon, idk to whom I have to deal with it for now...",Neutral,1
